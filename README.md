## Overview

MVP is a project that provides a full stack web application, allowing users to create a custom MVP product. The app uses React for the front end, MongoDB for the database, Express.js for the server, Node.js for the backend and Material UI for styling. It allows users to create their own MVP product and view the progress of their product.
